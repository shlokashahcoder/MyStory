Once upon a tiwq
me, in a forest there lived a monkey who resisded on a jamun tree which was on the bank of a river
in the same forest there lived a crocodile and his wife 
One day the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree. The kind hearted monkey offered him some
fruits. The crocodile came back the next day for more fruits as he loved them.
as dayesc`s passed the crocodile and the monkey became good friends.
